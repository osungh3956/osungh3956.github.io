Relationship with Linear Operator U #
The basis transformation matrix $A$, i.e., $e_i = A e_{i&amp;rsquo;} = A_i^{j&amp;rsquo;} e_{j&amp;rsquo;}$, appears not to be a tensor at first glance since it uses both unprimed and primed indices, suggesting it&amp;rsquo;s not a notation with respect to a single basis.
However, $A$ can effectively be considered a tensor with respect to the unprimed basis.
Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a linear operator $U$ that transforms the basis as $e_i = U e_i&amp;rsquo;$.</description></item><item><title>- Properties of Tensor Products and Tensors</title><link>https://osungh3956.github.io/en/docs/jeevanjee/tensors/tensor-product/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osungh3956.github.io/en/docs/jeevanjee/tensors/tensor-product/</guid><description>1. Universal Property of Tensor Products #
As we examined in the previous definition of tensor products, when we define $u \otimes v = f(u,v)$ where $f(u,v)$ is a bilinear function on elements $u, v$ of vector spaces $U, V$, and since $u \otimes v = g(u,v)$ holds an isomorphism relation (universal property), $u \otimes v$ is uniquely defined except for this isomorphism relation.
2. Bilinearity of Tensor Products #
Also, due to the bilinearity of function $f$, the following relations hold: $$ (u_1 + c u_2) \otimes v = u_1 \otimes v + c u_2 \otimes v, $$</description></item><item><title>- The Relationship Between Tensor Product Representation of Identity Matrix and Dirac Notation</title><link>https://osungh3956.github.io/en/docs/jeevanjee/tensors/the-relationship-between-tensor-product-representation-of-identity-matrix-and-dirac-notation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 10:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://osungh3956.github.io/en/docs/jeevanjee/tensors/the-relationship-between-tensor-product-representation-of-identity-matrix-and-dirac-notation/</guid><description>1. Tensor Operations #
$$(e^i \otimes e_j)(v,f) = e^i(v) e_j(f)$$
2. Tensors as Linear Operators #
\begin{equation*} \begin{aligned} (e^i \otimes e_j)(\boldsymbol{v},f) &amp;amp;= f((e^i \otimes e_j)(\boldsymbol{v})) \\ \text{,where }\ (e^i \otimes e_j)(\boldsymbol{v}) = e^i(\boldsymbol{v}) e_j \\ &amp;amp;= f(e^i(\boldsymbol{v}) e_j) \\ &amp;amp;= e^i(\boldsymbol{v}) f(e_j) \\ \text{,where } \ f(e_j) = e_j(f) \\ &amp;amp;= e^i(\boldsymbol{v}) e_j(f) \end{aligned} \end{equation*}
3. Using Metric Duality #
$$(e^i(v) e_j(f) = (e_i | v) (e^j | f)$$
4. Definition of Tensor Product Inner Product #
$$(v_1 \otimes w_1|v_2 \otimes w_2) = (v_1|v_2) (w_1|w_2)$$</description></item></channel></rss>
